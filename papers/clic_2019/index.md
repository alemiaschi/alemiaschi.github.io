summary: "This paper presents a method for prerequisite learning classification between educational concepts. The proposed system was developed by adapting a classification algorithm designed for sequencing Learning Objects to the task of ordering concepts from a computer science textbook. In order to apply the system to the new task, for each concept we automatically created a learning unit from the textbook using two criteria based on concept occurrences and burst intervals. Results are promising and suggest that further improvements could highly benefit the results."

##### Abstract

This paper presents a method for prerequisite learning classification between educational concepts. The proposed system was developed by adapting a classification algorithm designed for sequencing Learning Objects to the task of ordering concepts from a computer science textbook. In order to apply the system to the new task, for each concept we automatically created a learning unit from the textbook using two criteria based on concept occurrences and burst intervals. Results are promising and suggest that further improvements could highly benefit the results.
