##### Abstract

The Codice Pelavicino Digitale Project aims to publish an online digital edition of the relevant manuscript of the XIII century. In this paper features of the edition and related issues are addressed. Secondly we explain motivations for choosing a digital edition as a medium: we address the background, and common concerns in the context of Academy and clerical and historical archives. Finally we give insights on the international standard adopted to markup the text, i.e. XML-TEI, and EVT, a tool adopted to generate the final website and display texts and images.
