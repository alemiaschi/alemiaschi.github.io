MAIA differs from other available video benchmarks for its design, its reasoning categories, the metric it uses and the language and culture of the videos. It evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on two aligned tasks: a visual statement verification task, and an open-ended visual question-answering task, both on the same set of video-related questions. It considers twelve reasoning categories that aim to disentangle language and vision relations by highlight when one of two alone encodes sufficient information to solve the tasks, when they are both needed and when the full richness of the short video is essential instead of just a part of it. Thanks to its carefully taught design, it evaluates VLMs’ consistency and visually grounded natural language comprehension and generation simultaneously through an aggregated metric.

While traditional retrieval-based strategies can commonly be used to address this issue, wordplays and other lateral thinking strategies limit the effectiveness of conventional lexical and semantic approaches. In this work, we address the clue answering task as an information retrieval problem exploiting the potential of encoder-based Transformer models to learn a shared latent space between clues and solutions. In particular, we propose for the first time a collection of siamese and asymmetric dual encoder architectures trained to capture the complex properties and relation characterizing crossword clues and their solutions for the Italian language. After comparing various architectures for this task, we show that the strong retrieval capabilities of these systems extend to neologisms and dictionary terms, suggesting their potential use in linguistic analyses beyond the scope of language games.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-09-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Cristiano Ciaccio,&#8201;Gabriele Sarti,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Crossword Space: Latent Manifold Learning for Italian Crosswords and Beyond [🏆 Best Student Paper Award 🏆]" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/clic_2025_1/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>MAIA: a Benchmark for Multimodal AI Assessment</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>CLiC-it 2025</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>We introduce MAIA (Multimodal AI Assessment), a multimodal dataset developed as a core component of a competence-oriented benchmark designed for fine-grained investigation of the reasoning abilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs) on videos. The MAIA benchmark is characterized by several distinctive features. To the best of our knowledge, MAIA is the first Italian-native benchmark addressing video understanding: videos were carefully selected to reflect Italian culture, and the language data (i.e., questions and reference answers) were produced by native-Italian speakers. Second, MAIA explicitly includes twelve reasoning categories that are specifically designed to assess the reasoning abilities of VLMs on videos. Third, we structured the dataset to support two aligned tasks (i.e., a statement verification and an open-ended visual question answering) built on the same datapoints, this way allowing to assess VLM coherence across task formats. Finally MAIA integrates, by design, state-of-the-art LLMs in the development process of the benchmark, taking advantage of their linguistic and reasoning capabilities both for data augmentation and for assessing and improving the overall quality of the data. In the paper we focus on the design principles and the data collection methodology, highlighting how MAIA provides a significant advancement with respect to other available dataset for VLM benchmarking.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-09-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Davide Testa,&#8201;Giovanni Bonetta,&#8201;Raffaella Bernardi,&#8201;Alessandro Bondielli,&#8201;Alessandro Lenci,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Lucia Passaro,&#8201;Bernardo Magnini</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to MAIA: a Benchmark for Multimodal AI Assessment" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/clic_2025_3/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The OuLiBench Benchmark: Formal Constraints as a Lens into LLM Linguistic Competence</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>CLiC-it 2025</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to impressive capabilities in Natural Language Generation (NLG). However, standard evaluation benchmarks often focus on surface-level performance and are predominantly English-centric, limiting insights into models’ deeper linguistic competences, especially in other languages. In this paper, we introduce OuLiBench, a novel benchmark inspired by the literary movement OuLiPo, designed to evaluate LLMs’ ability to generate Italian text under explicit linguistic constraints, ranging from morpho-syntactic requirements to creative and structural challenges. Our goal is to assess the extent to which LLMs can understand and manipulate language when guided by specific, sometimes artificial constraints. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art models in both zero- and few-shot settings, comparing performance across constraint types and difficulty levels. Our results highlight significant variability across models and tasks, shedding light on the limits of controllable text generation and offering a new lens for probing LLMs’ generative and linguistic competence beyond traditional benchmarks.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-09-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Silvio Calderaro,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The OuLiBench Benchmark: Formal Constraints as a Lens into LLM Linguistic Competence" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/clic_2025_2/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Beyond the Spelling Miracle: Investigating Substring Awareness in Character-Blind Language Models</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>Findings of ACL 2025</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Correctly identifying characters and substrings of words should be a basic but essential ability of any Language Model that aims to proficiently understand and produce language.

To shed light on this phenomenon, we systematically evaluate a range of PLMs with different parameter sizes using a controlled binary substring identification task.

Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of state-of-the-art MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed adversarial attacks. We develop a pipeline that fine-tunes language models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward human-written text (HWT), obtaining generations more challenging to detect by current models. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and how detectors rely on “linguistic shortcuts” to detect texts. Our results show that detectors can be easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in detecting performances. This highlights the importance of improving detection methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts. We release code, models, and data to support future research on more robust MGT detection benchmarks.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-07-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Andrea Pedrotti,&#8201;Michele Papucci,&#8201;Cristiano Ciaccio,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Giovanni Puccetti,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Andrea Esuli</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Stress-testing Machine Generated Text Detection: Shifting Language Models Writing Style to Fool Detectors" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/acl_2025_1/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Parallel Trees: a novel resource with aligned dependency and constituency syntactic representations</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>Language Resources and Evaluation (LRE)</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>The paper introduces Parallel Trees, a novel multilingual treebank collection that includes 20 treebanks for 10 languages.

By aligning the annotations of existing resources, Parallel Trees represents an example of exploiting pre-existing treebanks to adapt them to novel applications. To illustrate its potential, we present a case study where the resource is employed as a benchmark to investigate whether and how BERT, one of the first prominent neural language models (NLMs), is sensitive to the dependency- and constituency-based approaches for representing the syntactic structure of a sentence. The case study results indicate that the model’s sensitivity fluctuates across languages and experimental settings.

While they can often handle other languages due to contamination or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, English-centric LLMs are not optimized for non-English languages. This leads to inefficient encoding (high token ‘fertility’) and slower inference times for those languages. In this work, we explore various vocabulary adaptation techniques to tailor English LLMs for the Italian language. We introduce Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a novel method that learns neural mapping to accomplish vocabulary substitution, which achieve state-of-the-art performances on several downstream tasks. We adapted two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing token fertility by 25%, and Llama-3.1-8b, optimizing the vocabulary and reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, after the adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performances with a relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally, we test the adapted models’ capabilities on several multi-choice and generative tasks.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-04-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Luca Moroni,&#8201;Giovanni Puccetti,&#8201;Pere-Lluís Huguet Cabot,&#8201;Andrei Stefan Bejgu,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Edoardo Barba,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Andrea Esuli,&#8201;Roberto Navigli</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/naacl_2025/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Leveraging encoder-only large language models for mobile app review feature extraction</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>Empirical Software Engineering, Volume 30 (2025)</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Mobile app review analysis presents unique challenges due to the low quality, subjective bias, and noisy content of user-generated documents. Extracting features from these reviews is essential for tasks such as feature prioritization and sentiment analysis, but it remains a challenging task.

This study explores the hypothesis that encoder-only large language models can enhance feature extraction from mobile app reviews. By leveraging crowdsourced annotations from an industrial context, we redefine feature extraction as a supervised token classification task. Our approach includes extending the pre-training of these models with a large corpus of user reviews to improve contextual understanding and employing instance selection techniques to optimize model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these methods improve the precision and recall of extracted features and enhance performance efficiency. Key contributions include a novel approach to feature extraction, annotated datasets, extended pre-trained models, and an instance selection mechanism for cost-effective fine-tuning. This research provides practical methods and empirical evidence in applying large language models to natural language processing tasks within mobile app reviews, offering improved performance in feature extraction.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-04-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Quim Motger,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Xavier Franch,&#8201;Jordi Marco</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Leveraging encoder-only large language models for mobile app review feature extraction" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/ese/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>Web Conference 2025 (WWW 2025)</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse.

We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-04-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 2025</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Lorenzo Cima,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Amaury Trujillo,&#8201;Marco Avvenuti,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Stefano Cresci</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/www_2025/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Controllable Text Generation To Evaluate Linguistic Abilities of Italian LLMs</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>CLiC-it 2024</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional proficiency across diverse tasks, yet systematic evaluations of their linguistic abilities remain limited.

Our findings shed light on the linguistic proficiency of LLMs, revealing both their capabilities and limitations in generating linguistically-constrained sentences.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-11-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 2024</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Giulia Venturi</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Evaluating Large Language Models via Linguistic Profiling" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/emnlp_2024/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Linguistic Knowledge Can Enhance Encoder-Decoder Models (If You Let It)</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>LREC-COLING 2024</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>In this paper, we explore the impact of augmenting pre-trained Encoder-Decoder models, specifically T5, with linguistic knowledge for the prediction of a target task. In particular, we investigate whether fine-tuning a T5 model on an intermediate task that predicts structural linguistic properties of sentences modifies its performance in the target task of predicting sentence-level complexity. Our study encompasses diverse experiments conducted on Italian and English datasets, employing both monolingual and multilingual T5 models at various sizes. Results obtained for both languages and in cross-lingual configurations show that linguistically motivated intermediate fine-tuning has generally a positive impact on target task performance, especially when applied to smaller models and in scenarios with limited data availability.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-05-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>May 2024</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Giulia Venturi</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Linguistic Knowledge Can Enhance Encoder-Decoder Models (If You Let It)" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/lrec_coling_2024/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>T-FREX: A Transformer-based Feature Extraction Method for Mobile App Reviews</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>SANER 2024</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Mobile app reviews are a large-scale data source for software-related knowledge generation activities, including software maintenance, evolution and feedback analysis. Effective extraction of features (i.e., functionalities or characteristics) from these reviews is key to support analysis on the acceptance of these features, identification of relevant new feature requests and prioritization of feature development, among others. Traditional methods focus on syntactic pattern-based approaches, typically context-agnostic, evaluated on a closed set of apps, difficult to replicate and limited to a reduced set and domain of apps. Meanwhile, the pervasiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture in software engineering tasks lays the groundwork for empirical evaluation of the performance of these models to support feature extraction. In this study, we present T-FREX, a Transformer-based, fully automatic approach for mobile app review feature extraction. First, we collect a set of ground truth features from users in a real crowdsourced software recommendation platform and transfer them automatically into a dataset of app reviews. Then, we use this newly created dataset to fine-tune multiple LLMs on a named entity recognition task under different data configurations. We assess the performance of T-FREX with respect to this ground truth, and we complement our analysis by comparing T-FREX with a baseline method from the field. Finally, we assess the quality of new features predicted by T-FREX through an external human evaluation. Results show that T-FREX outperforms on average the traditional syntactic-based method, especially when discovering new features from a domain for which the model has been fine-tuned.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 2024</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Quim Motger,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Xavier Franch,&#8201;Jordi Marco</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to T-FREX: A Transformer-based Feature Extraction Method for Mobile App Reviews" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/saner_2024/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Lost in Labels: An Ongoing Quest to Optimize Text-to-Text Label Selection for Classification</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>CLiC-it 2023</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>In this paper, we present an evaluation of the influence of label selection on the performance of a Sequence-to-Sequence Transformer model in a classification task. Our study investigates whether the choice of words used to represent classification categories affects the model’s performance, and if there exists a relationship between the model’s performance and the selected words. To achieve this, we fine-tuned an Italian T5 model on topic classification using various labels. Our results indicate that the different label choices can significantly impact the model’s performance. That being said, we did not find a clear answer on how these choices affect the model performances, highlighting the need for further research in optimizing label selection.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2023-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 2023</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Michele Papucci,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Lost in Labels: An Ongoing Quest to Optimize Text-to-Text Label Selection for Classification" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/clic_2023_2/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Unmasking the Wordsmith: Revealing Author Identity through Reader Reviews</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>CLiC-it 2023</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Traditional genre-based approaches for book recommendations face challenges due to the vague definition of genres.

To this aim, we first introduce the `Literary Voices Corpus’ (LVC), a dataset of Italian book reviews, and use it to train and test machine learning models. Our study contributes valuable insights for developing user-centric systems that recommend leisure readings based on individual readers’ interests and writing styles.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2023-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 2023</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Chiara Alzetta,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Chiara Fazzone,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Giulia Venturi</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Unmasking the Wordsmith: Revealing Author Identity through Reader Reviews" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/clic_2023_1/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>LangLearn at EVALITA 2023: Overview of the Language Learning Development Task</h2><p class=entry-venue style=font-weight:600;font-size:.9em;margin-top:.25em;color:#555>EVALITA 2023</p></header><div class=entry-content><p>Language Learning Development (LangLearn) is the EVALITA 2023 shared task on automatic language development assessment, which consists in predicting the evolution of the written language abilities of learners across time.

The authors propose a corpus-based study focused on the analysis of A Good Review, a novel corpus of online book reviews written in Italian, posted on Amazon and Goodreads, and covering six literary fiction genres. The authors rely on stylometric analysis to explore the linguistic properties and lexicon of reviews and the authors conducted automatic classification experiments using multiple approaches and feature configurations to predict either the review’s platform or the literary genre. The analysis of user-generated reviews demonstrates that language is a quite variable dimension across reading platforms, but not as much across book genres. The classification experiments revealed that features modelling the syntactic structure of the sentence are reliable proxies for discerning Amazon and Goodreads reviews, whereas lexical information showed a higher predictive role for automatically discriminating the genre. The high availability of cultural products makes information services necessary to help users navigate these resources and acquire information from unstructured data. This study contributes to a better understanding of the linguistic characteristics of user-generated book reviews, which can support the development of linguistically-informed recommendation services. Additionally, the authors release a novel corpus of online book reviews meant to support the reproducibility and advancements of the research.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2023-06-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 2023</span>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;Chiara Alzetta,&#8201;Felice Dell'Orletta,&#8201;Alessio Miaschi,&#8201;Giulia Venturi</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Tell me how you write and I'll tell you what you read: a study on the writing style of book reviews" href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/documentation/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=next href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/papers/page/2/>Next&nbsp;&nbsp;»</a></nav></footer></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 Alessio Miaschi</span> ·
