    abstract = "Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo extensive evaluation against various benchmarks collected in established leaderboards to assess their performance across multiple tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive studies evaluating these models{'} linguistic abilities independent of specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to test LLMs{'} sentence generation abilities under specific linguistic constraints. Drawing on the {`}linguistic profiling{'} approach, we rigorously investigate the extent to which five LLMs of varying sizes, tested in both zero- and few-shot scenarios, effectively adhere to (morpho)syntactic constraints. Our findings shed light on the linguistic proficiency of LLMs, revealing both their capabilities and limitations in generating linguistically-constrained sentences.",
