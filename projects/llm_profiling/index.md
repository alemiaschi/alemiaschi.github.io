### Description

This repository contains data associated with the EMNLP 2024 paper <a href='https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.166.pdf'>Evaluating Large Language Models via Linguistic Profiling</a>.
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo extensive evaluation against various benchmarks collected in established leaderboards to assess their performance across multiple tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive studies evaluating these models' linguistic abilities independent of specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to test LLMs' sentence generation abilities under specific linguistic constraints. Drawing on the `linguistic profiling' approach, we rigorously investigate the extent to which five LLMs of varying sizes, tested in both zero- and few-shot scenarios, effectively adhere to (morpho)syntactic constraints. Our findings shed light on the linguistic proficiency of LLMs, revealing both their capabilities and limitations in generating linguistically-constrained sentences.
