I am glad to announce that on September 21 I will give a 
talk at the International Summer School on "Advances in Artificial 
Intelligence" (see below for the details). The main purpose of the school is to gather scholars, 
researchers and PhD students to learn and explore the main advanced 
topics offered by AI with a wide look towards new perspectives coming 
by innovative technological scenarios. <br/>

<h3><b>Title</b>: Profiling Neural Language Models</h3><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has 
seen an unprecedented progress in the last years. Much of this progress 
is due to the replacement of traditional systems with newer and more 
powerful algorithms based on neural networks and deep learning. This 
improvement, however, comes at the cost of interpretability, since deep 
neural models offer little transparency about their inner workings and their abilities. Therefore, in the last few years, an increasingly large body of work has been devoted to the analysis and interpretation of these models.<br/>

This presentation will be divided into two parts. In the first part, we will briefly introduce state-of-the-art Neural Language Models (NLMs) and discuss their characteristics. In the second part we will cover the most commonly applied analysis methods for understanding the inner behavior of NLMs based on Transformer architectures and how they implicitly encode linguistic knowledge.
