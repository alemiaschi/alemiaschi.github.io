A Linguistic Investigation on Neural Language Models Perplexity'</i> (with Dominique Brunato, Felice Dell'Orletta and Giulia Venturi): We studied how the linguistic structure of a sentence affects the perplexity of BERT and GPT-2 models (accepted at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/deelio-ws/' target='_blank'>DeeLIO 2021</a>).</li>
<li><i>'How Do BERT Embeddings Organize Linguistic Knowledge?'</i> (with Giovanni Puccetti e Felice Dell'Orletta): We proposed a study, based on Lasso regression, to understand how the information encoded by BERT sentence-level representations is arrange within its hidden units (accepted at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/deelio-ws/' target='_blank'>DeeLIO 2021</a>).</li>
<li><i>'Teaching NLP with Bracelets and Restaurant Menus: An Interactive Workshop for Italian Students'</i> (with Ludovica Pannitto, Lucia Busso, Claudia Roberta Combei, Lucio Messina, Gabriele Sarti e Malvina Nissim): We illustrated an interactive workshop designed to delinate the basic principles of NLP and computational linguistics to high school Italian students aged between 13 and 18 years (accepted at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/teaching-nlp-workshop/home?authuser=0' target='_blank'>Teaching NLP 2021</a>).</li>
