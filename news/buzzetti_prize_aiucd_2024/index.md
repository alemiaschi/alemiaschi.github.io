I am really happy to announce that I was awarded by <a href='http://www.aiucd.it/'>AIUCD</a> with the 2023 Prize 'Premio di ricerca Dino Buzzetti'! The prize will fund a small project, based on the development of a book recommender system. In particular, during the project, I will first of all collect reviews from popular Digital Social Reading platforms, such as Goodreads and Anobii. Then, I plan to conduct a comprehensive human evaluation campaign to verify whether (and how) certain reviews are likely to be of interest for future readers. Another aspect of the project involves exploring the capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) to generate fictional reviews and assessing their impact on the overall evaluation campaign. <br/> All the informations are available at this link: <a href='http://www.aiucd.it/premio-buzzetti-2023-a-alessio-miaschi/'>http://www.aiucd.it/premio-buzzetti-2023-a-alessio-miaschi/</a>.
