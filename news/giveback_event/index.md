I am glad to announce the first PhD Giveback Event, which I organized together with Irene Sucameli and prof. Ferragina. It will be a great half-day event, during which former PhD students of our Department who now works for prestigious companies, will present themselves to the current PhD and MA students, talking about their post-doc experience as well as their current research activities within the respective companies. <br/>For more information please visit the <a href='http://givebackevent.di.unipi.it'>website</a>.
