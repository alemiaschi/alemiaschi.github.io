Title: Evaluating Linguistic Abilities of Neural Language Models
Abstract: The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, driven largely by the shift from traditional approaches to state-of-the-art neural network-based algorithms. Among these, Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and in generating coherent and contextually relevant texts. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of interpretability, since deep neural models offer little transparency about their inner workings and their abilities. In response, a growing body of research is dedicated to evaluating and interpreting LLMs, aiming to shed light on the inner workings and linguistic abilities encoded by these systems. This talk explores recent studies that shed light on these abilities, highlighting how such insights enhance our understanding of model behaviour across various applications."><meta name=author content="Alessio Miaschi"><link rel=canonical href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/nlp4re_2025/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.ac30954b7ea20660ca1cb473400ecede9e601f17674446536180d3ca00f03328.css integrity="sha256-rDCVS36iBmDKHLRzQA7O3p5gHxdnREZTYYDTygDwMyg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/nlp4re_2025/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/nlp4re_2025/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Alessio Miaschi"><meta property="og:title" content="Invited Talk at NLP4RE @ REFSQ 2025 (Barcelona, Spain)"><meta property="og:description" content="On April 7 I will give an invated talk during the REFSQ 2025 Workshop NLP4RE.
