Title: A Theoretical and Practical Introduction to Neural Language Models: Evaluating and Exploring their Linguistic Abilities
Abstract: The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, driven largely by the shift from traditional approaches to state-of-the-art neural network-based algorithms. Among these, Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and in generating coherent and contextually relevant texts. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of interpretability, since deep neural models offer little transparency about their inner workings and their abilities.
This talk will offer an overview of Language Models and the recent advancements achieved in this area, with a specific focus on studies investigating their implicit linguistic abilities and how these insights can enhance our understanding of model behaviour across various tasks and applications. In the second part, we will move to a more practical hands-on session, providing participants with an introduction to how these models can be used and explored in practice."><meta name=author content="Alessio Miaschi"><link rel=canonical href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/autumn_school_ai_2025/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.ac30954b7ea20660ca1cb473400ecede9e601f17674446536180d3ca00f03328.css integrity="sha256-rDCVS36iBmDKHLRzQA7O3p5gHxdnREZTYYDTygDwMyg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/autumn_school_ai_2025/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://alemiaschi.github.io/news/autumn_school_ai_2025/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Alessio Miaschi"><meta property="og:title" content="Lesson at the Autumn School in AI, PhD in Digital Humanities (Università di Genova)"><meta property="og:description" content="On November 11 I will give a lesson with my colleague Cristiano Ciaccio during the Autumn School in AI of the PhD Program in Digital Humanities (Università di Genova).
