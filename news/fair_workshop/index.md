On February 20 I will give a talk during the FAIR Spoke Workshop 2025 at Sapienza Università di Roma.

<h3><b>Title</b>: Controllable Text Generation for Evaluating LLMs' Linguistic Competence</h3><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will provide an overview of the results obtained in the context of the FAIR project (Spoke 5) focused on the evaluation of the linguistic abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, I will highlight results from research on Controllable Text Generation (CTG), with a specific focus on the assessment of LLMs' abilities to generate text while adhering to specific linguistic constraints.
