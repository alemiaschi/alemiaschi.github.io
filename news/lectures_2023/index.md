I am glad to announce that on May 31 I will be hosting with <a href="https://gsarti.com/">Gabriele Sarti</a> a laboratory focused on the interpretability of Neural Language Models (NLMs) at the 2023 edition of the Lectures on Computational Linguistics. <br/>Below you can find title and abstract of the lab:
<br/>
<h3><b>Title</b>: Explaining Neural Language Models from Internal Representations to Model Predictions</h3><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: As language models become increasingly complex and sophisticated, the processes leading to their predictions are growing increasingly difficult to understand. Research in NLP interpretability focuses on explaining the rationales driving model predictions and is crucial for building trust and transparency in the usage of these systems in real-world scenarios.

In this laboratory, we will explore various techniques for analyzing Neural Language Models, such as feature attribution methods and diagnostic classifiers. Besides common approaches to inspect models’ internal representations, we will also introduce prompting techniques to elicit model responses and motivate their usage as alternative methods for the behavioral study of model generations.
